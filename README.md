## Cybersecurity Focus

I'm a passionate and dedicated Jr Penetration Tester with a strong interest in offensive cybersecurity. My journey in cybersecurity began in early 2023, and since then, I've been building up my skills and credentials through hands-on labs, certifications, and practical projects.

My primary focus is in penetration testing and offensive security. I began my cybersecurity path by earning the following certifications:

### Certificates

üîê [CompTIA Security+ ce (Nov 2024)](https://www.credly.com/badges/b856b0d7-bb20-466c-8981-b7744f8bb64f/public_url)

I've also explored front-end web development to strengthen my understanding of web application security. Although I initially shifted to web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I quickly realized how foundational knowledge in web apps enhances my penetration testing approach.

I've completed several cybersecurity projects and hands-on labs on platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, PortSwigger Web Security Academy, and by building virtual home labs. These experiences have enhanced my understanding of real-world attack techniques, vulnerability exploitation, and report writing. I consistently sharpen my skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and technical write-ups.

## Social Media Marketing

Alongside my technical expertise, I am also building a career in Social Media Marketing, particularly in campaign management, content creation, and performance tracking. I‚Äôve earned the Meta Social Media Marketing Certificate (May 2024):

### Key Aspects of My Work

Campaign Strategy: Developing comprehensive strategies to increase brand visibility and engagement.

Content Creation: Designing and producing engaging content tailored to target audiences.

Performance Tracking: Monitoring metrics to refine strategies and achieve campaign goals.

## Design Background

Though I initially explored front-end web development, I found that UI/UX design via Figma aligns better with my creative side. I use these design skills to create user-friendly and visually appealing content, especially for digital campaigns. This includes developing design elements like personas, user journey maps, and high-fidelity prototypes for web design, which I can adapt for social media content as well. Additionally, I leverage Canva for creating quick, shareable visuals and templates that maintain consistency across various platforms.

This is the course I learned to use Figma.
