***Penetration Tester | UI/UX Designer | Digital Marketer | Founder & Owner of the Hexterika brand identity and its company Hexterika-Breaks-Free***

## Summary

I'm a self-taught and self-driven professional with a multidisciplinary background across cybersecurity (penetration testing), UI/UX design, frontend development, and social media marketing. My path hasn't been linear ‚Äî it‚Äôs shaped by curiosity, adaptability, and a deep commitment to continuous learning.

In cybersecurity, I specialize in offensive security and penetration testing, supported by hands-on labs, certifications, and real-world practice. My foundation in frontend development and UI/UX design gives me an edge in understanding how applications are built and how users interact with them ‚Äî a perspective that enhances both my red teaming and design capabilities. At the same time, I‚Äôve built strong experience in social media marketing, focusing on content strategy, campaign management, and performance tracking.

What ties it all together is the ability to see digital systems from multiple angles ‚Äî as a user, a designer, a marketer, and a security tester. This broad but interconnected skill set helps me approach complex problems with both creativity and precision.

To organize and represent these diverse skills, I created Hexterika ‚Äî not just a brand, but a personal platform to showcase my journey, projects, and service offerings across these fields.

## Cybersecurity Focus

I'm a passionate and dedicated Jr Penetration Tester with a strong interest in offensive cybersecurity. My journey in cybersecurity began in early 2023, and since then, I've been building up my skills and credentials through hands-on labs, certifications, and practical projects.

My primary focus is in penetration testing and offensive security. I began my cybersecurity path by earning the following certifications:

### Certificates

I've also explored front-end web development to strengthen my understanding of web application security. Although I initially shifted to web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I quickly realized how foundational knowledge in web apps enhances my penetration testing approach.

![ProgrammingWithJavaScript](Images/ProgrammingWithJavaScript.png)

I've completed several cybersecurity projects and hands-on labs on platforms like TryHackMe, Hack The Box, PortSwigger Web Security Academy, and by building virtual home labs. These experiences have enhanced my understanding of real-world attack techniques, vulnerability exploitation, and report writing. I consistently sharpen my skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and technical write-ups.

### Key Aspects of My Work

Campaign Strategy: Developing comprehensive strategies to increase brand visibility and engagement.

Content Creation: Designing and producing engaging content tailored to target audiences.

Performance Tracking: Monitoring metrics to refine strategies and achieve campaign goals.

## Design Background

Though I initially explored front-end web development, I found that UI/UX design via Figma aligns better with my creative side. I use these design skills to create user-friendly and visually appealing content, especially for digital campaigns. This includes developing design elements like personas, user journey maps, and high-fidelity prototypes for web design, which I can adapt for social media content as well. Additionally, I leverage Canva for creating quick, shareable visuals and templates that maintain consistency across various platforms.

    + Enrolled in a Canadian engineering program during COVID-19, attending live classes overnight in my local time zone.
    + Although I was committed, the combination of poor time management and financial constraints made it challenging to sustain the program. Ultimately, I chose to step back and reassess my path, realizing the need for better balance between work, study, and personal life.
    + As a result of this reassessment, I formally left the engineering program and began working at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute‚Äîmarking a clear pivot toward hands-on, practical work and a new professional direction.
  + **Developed Time Management Through Diverse Roles**
    + While enrolled, I also worked part-time as a freelance tech support, assisting a senator with her online conference and enabling smooth remote work.
    + This role involved both onsite and remote responsibilities and marked my early experience in multitasking, time management, and coordinating tasks that depended on global time considerations.
    + Learned to juggle overlapping responsibilities‚Äîtechnical support, client coordination, and adapting to shifting schedules‚Äîwhich strengthened my multitasking and prioritization skills.
  + **Practical Time Management Skills Developed Since 2022**
    + Built and refined personal systems to manage independent work, study, and project goals effectively.
    + Focused on balancing various responsibilities across different time zones (e.g., Bangkok and Romania).
  + **Timezone-Aware Planning and Scheduling**
    + Practice time zone coordination for personal projects, including scheduling and planning across regions.
    + Developed the ability to work autonomously and adjust schedules to optimize productivity.
+ ***Result:*** I bring strong, self-developed time management and cross-timezone scheduling skills, ready to manage remote work and collaboration.
